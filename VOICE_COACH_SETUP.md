## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get API Keys

#### OpenAI API Key (for text generation)
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

#### ElevenLabs API Key (for voice synthesis)
1. Visit [ElevenLabs Platform](https://elevenlabs.io/app/speech-synthesis/text-to-speech)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Go to your Profile settings
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the `fitflick/` directory and add:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

**Important Security Notes:**

## Coaching Structure

The voice coach follows a structured three-phase approach for each exercise:

### üìã **Phase 1: Get Ready (Instant)**
- **When**: At the beginning of each exercise during the "Get Ready" countdown
- **Purpose**: Quick motivation to prepare for the exercise (hard-coded for zero lag)
- **Example**: *"Get ready, Shahar! Time for Push Ups. This is exercise 3 of 12. Let's do this!"*

### üéØ **Phase 2: Exercise Instructions (Start of Workout)**
- **When**: Immediately when workout begins (pre-generated during get-ready phase)
- **Purpose**: Explains proper form, technique, and safety tips
- **Example**: *"Shahar, for Push Ups: Keep your core engaged, lower your chest to the floor with control, and push back up. Focus on quality over speed!"*

### üí™ **Phase 3: Mid-Workout Motivation (10 seconds in)**
- **When**: Exactly 10 seconds into each exercise (pre-generated during get-ready phase)
- **Purpose**: Energetic pep talk to keep you motivated
- **Example**: *"Great form, Shahar! Feel that strength building - you've got this!"*

### üòå **Phase 4: Rest Announcement (Rest Period)**
- **When**: At the start of each rest period
- **Purpose**: Acknowledge completion and guide recovery
- **Example**: *"Excellent work, Shahar! Time to breathe and recover. Get ready for what's next!"*

## Performance Optimization

### üöÄ **Zero-Lag System**
The voice coach uses an intelligent pre-generation system to eliminate delays:

1. **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Instant Get-Ready**: Hard-coded messages play immediately
2. **‚ö° Background Generation**: While get-ready plays, AI generates upcoming messages
3. **üì¶ Smart Caching**: Generated audio is cached for instant playback
4. **üéØ Perfect Timing**: All voice coaching happens at the exact right moment

### üîÑ **Pre-Generation Timeline**
```
Get-Ready Phase (10s):  [Play hard-coded message] + [Generate instruction] + [Generate motivation]
Workout Start (0s):     [Play pre-generated instruction]
Workout 10s:            [Play pre-generated motivation]
Rest Phase:             [Play rest announcement]
```

This system ensures that every voice message plays instantly without any lag!

## Customization

### Customizing AI Prompts
All AI prompts are centralized in `src/services/fitnessCoachPrompts.ts` for easy review and modification:

```typescript
// Edit these functions to customize the AI coaching style
export function generateInstructionPrompt(context: PromptContext): string {
  // Modify this prompt for exercise instructions
}

export function generateMotivationPrompt(context: PromptContext): string {
  // Modify this prompt for mid-workout motivation
}

export function generateRestAnnouncementPrompt(context: PromptContext): string {
  // Modify this prompt for rest period announcements
}
```

### Changing the User Name
Edit the `userName` parameter in the `PepTalkOptions` calls in `FitnessCalendarApp.tsx`:

```typescript
const pepTalkOptions: PepTalkOptions = {
  // ... other options
  userName: 'YourName', // Change from 'Shahar' to your preferred name
  // ... other options
};
```

### Adjusting Motivation Timing
In `FitnessCalendarApp.tsx`, modify the motivation delay:

```typescript
}, 10000); // 10 seconds delay - change this value to adjust timing
```

### Voice Settings
In `fitnessVoiceCoach.ts`, adjust ElevenLabs voice parameters:

```typescript
const VOICE_CONFIG = {
  voiceId: 'pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB', // Adam - energetic male voice
  modelId: 'eleven_turbo_v2_5', // Fast, high quality
  stability: 0.5,
  similarityBoost: 0.75,
  style: 0.5,
  useSpeakerBoost: true,
};
```

- **Speaker Boost**: Enhances speaker clarity

## Troubleshooting

### No Voice Output
- Check if your browser supports audio playback
- Ensure your device volume is turned up
- Try clicking the microphone button to toggle off and on
- Check browser console for any error messages

### API Errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Verify your ElevenLabs API key is correct
- Check that you have credits in both your OpenAI and ElevenLabs accounts
- Ensure the `.env.local` file is in the correct location
- Restart the development server after adding environment variables

### Voice Quality
- Uses ElevenLabs' premium TTS models for natural, expressive speech
- Supports multiple voice personalities and languages
- Voice selection can be changed by updating the `voiceId` in `VOICE_CONFIG`
- For optimal quality, use `eleven_turbo_v2_5` or `eleven_multilingual_v2` models

- Estimated cost: ~$0.10-0.20 per workout (ElevenLabs is slightly more expensive than OpenAI TTS but offers superior voice quality)
- ElevenLabs offers different pricing tiers based on usage

## Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support with high-quality audio playback
- **Safari**: Good support with system audio
- **Firefox**: Basic support, may have limited audio features
